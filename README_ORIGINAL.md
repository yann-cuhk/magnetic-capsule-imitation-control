## Simulation Cases:
### Case 1: Bronchoscopy Navigation Experiment

#### Scene Description:
![Bronchoscopy_Simulation](images/Bronchoscopy.png)

Bronchoscopy is an important medical tool for examining and treating lung diseases, and magnetic navigation technology can enhance its flexibility and navigation capabilities in complex airways. This simulation case simulates the navigation process of a magnetic navigation bronchoscope in segmental bronchi, demonstrating the impact of magnetic field on navigation performance.

#### Navigation Details:

![Bronchoscopy_Simulation](images/Bronchoscopy_.png)

The bronchoscope is modeled as a 2mm continuum robot with a 0.03 A·m² magnet at its tip. An external 6-joint manipulator controls the magnetic field, initially set at 350 A·m². The environment includes main, lobar, and segmental bronchi. The robot navigates from the upper trachea to the target point, with a friction coefficient of 0.015 and a 2mm collision detection distance. 

Detailed configuration parameters have been saved in the [Config_Scene/case1](https://github.com/MagRobotics/MagRobot-An-Open-Simulation-Platform-for-Magnetically-Navigated-Robots/tree/master/Config_Scene/Case1) folder.

#### Control Method:

**1. Manual navigation:**

   - **Insertion/retraction:**  
     * `CTRL + up/down`: Control insertion/retraction of the m-CR.

   - **Magnetic field direction:**
     * `CTRL + I/K`: Adjust inclination angle.
     * `CTRL + J/L`: Adjust azimuth angle.

**2. Automatic navigation:**

   - **Insertion/retraction:**  
     * `CTRL`: Control insertion/retraction of the m-CR.

   - **Magnetic field direction:**  
     * Automatic control via PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller).


### Case 2: Endovascular Intervention Simulation

#### Scene Description

![Endovascular_Simulation](images/Endovascular_Intervention.png)

Magnetic navigation endovascular intervention is a minimally invasive medical technology that navigates flexible catheters through arteries and veins for diagnosing and treating vascular diseases. Compared to traditional open surgery, this technology offers advantages of smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and lower complication risks. This simulation demonstrates the catheter robot's navigation process in the aortic arch, showing the impact of electromagnetic coil configurations on magnetic navigation performance and the combined application of magnetic drive and magnetic positioning.


#### Navigation Details

![Endovascular_Simulation](images/Endovascular_Intervention_.png)

In the simulation, a deformable geometric model of the aortic arch is used as the environment. The flexible catheter is modeled as a continuum robot with a permanent magnet of 0.03 A·m² magnetic moment embedded in its tip. An array of stationary electromagnets is used as the magnetic actuation source. The centerline of the aortic arch is extracted by the trajectory generator module, and the catheter robot follows this centerline at a constant advancement velocity of 35 mm/s.

Detailed configuration parameters have been saved in the [Config_Scene/case2](https://github.com/MagRobotics/MagRobot-An-Open-Simulation-Platform-for-Magnetically-Navigated-Robots/tree/master/Config_Scene/Case2) folder.

#### Control Method:

Identical to the `Case 1`


### Case 3: Magnetic Navigation Capsule Endoscopy Simulation

#### Scene Description:

Capsule endoscopy is a small, untethered device with built-in camera for examining digestive tract diseases. Compared to traditional tethered endoscopes, capsule endoscopy can reduce patient discomfort and reach target areas with higher precision. This simulation demonstrates the navigation process of capsule endoscopy in the gastrointestinal tract, showing hybrid magnetic actuation for multi-magnet, multi-robot navigation in deformable anatomy.

![Capsule_Endoscopy_Simulation](images/Capsule_Endoscopy.png)




#### Navigation Details:

![Capsule_Endoscopy_Simulation](images/Capsule_Endoscopy_.png)

The simulation uses a deformable anatomical model of the stomach. The capsule endoscope is modeled as a rigid-body robot with a permanent magnet for magnetic actuation. An array of eight stationary electromagnetic coils is used for actuation, and magnetic sensors are used for pose tracking. The simulation evaluates different sensor array configurations.

Detailed configuration parameters have been saved in the [Config_Scene/case3](https://github.com/MagRobotics/MagRobot-An-Open-Simulation-Platform-for-Magnetically-Navigated-Robots/tree/master/Config_Scene/Case3) folder.


#### Control Method:

Click the  `Start` button to begin the simulation.


### Case 4: Cardiac Electrophysiology

#### Scene Description:

![Cardiac_Electrophysiology](images/Cardiac_Electrophysiology.png)

Cardiac radiofrequency ablation is a mainstream minimally invasive procedure for treating arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. A catheter is delivered through the femoral vein into the right atrium, then through transseptal puncture into the left atrium to reach the four pulmonary vein ostia (LSPV, RSPV, LIPV, RIPV) for ablation. Magnetic navigation provides more dexterous bending than conventional pull-wire steering. This case validates the simulator for a **multi-magnet continuum robot** under complex anatomical constraints.

#### Navigation Details:

![Cardiac_Electrophysiology](images/Cardiac_Electrophysiology_.png)

A high-fidelity rigid heart model synthesized from CT scans is used as the environment, covering the path from the inferior vena cava to the left atrium. The flexible ablation catheter is modeled as a continuum robot, with a 0.04 A·m² permanent magnet embedded in its tip whose magnetization is deflected 15° from the catheter axis. A stationary array of **eight electromagnetic coils** provides actuation. The user advances the catheter and bends the tip via keyboard to reach the four pulmonary vein ostia for rotational ablation.

With a single tip magnet, the catheter collapses against the atrial wall during rotational ablation due to insufficient distal support. A second permanent magnet is therefore embedded coaxially in the sub-distal segment with a different magnetization direction. In this **dual-magnet configuration**, a closed-loop lateral position controller anchors the sub-distal magnet as a **virtual pivot**, while the distal tip remains under open-loop teleoperated orientation control — enabling smooth, uniform rotational ablation without wall collision.

Detailed configuration parameters have been saved in the [Config_Scene/case4](https://github.com/MagRobotics/MagRobot-An-Open-Simulation-Platform-for-Magnetically-Navigated-Robots/tree/master/Config_Scene/Case4) folder.

#### Control Method:

**1. Insertion / retraction:**
   * `CTRL + up/down`: Advance / retract the magnetic catheter robot.

**2. Distal-tip orientation (open-loop, teleoperated):**
   * `CTRL + I/K`: Adjust the inclination angle of the tip magnetic field.
   * `CTRL + J/L`: Adjust the azimuth angle of the tip magnetic field.

**3. Sub-distal anchoring (closed-loop lateral position control):**
   * Press `T` to engage the sub-distal anchor — the virtual pivot is activated and the sub-distal magnet is held at its target position by PID-regulated magnetic force.
   * Press `T` again to release the anchor — the catheter returns to single-magnet (tip-only) actuation.
